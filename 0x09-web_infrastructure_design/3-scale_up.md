1 Additional Server:

Adding an additional server provides redundancy and fault tolerance. If one server fails, the other server can continue to handle incoming traffic and maintain service availability.
1 Load-Balancer (HAProxy) Configured as a Cluster with the Other One:

Configuring HAProxy as a cluster with the other one enhances load balancer reliability and scalability. If one HAProxy instance fails, the other instance can seamlessly take over, ensuring uninterrupted load balancing and high availability.
Split Components (Web Server, Application Server, Database) with Their Own Server:

Splitting components onto their own dedicated servers improves resource isolation, performance, and scalability. Each component can be optimized independently, and failures or resource constraints in one component do not affect the others.

Web Server: Dedicated web servers are added to handle HTTP requests, serve static content, and communicate with clients (e.g., web browsers). Separating the web server from other components allows for better resource allocation and scalability, especially for serving static content and handling high traffic loads.

Application Server: Dedicated application servers are added to execute application logic, process dynamic content, and interact with the database. Separating the application server from the web server allows for better management of application resources, isolation of application logic, and scalability of application processing.

Database: Dedicated database servers are added to store and manage application data. Separating the database from other components allows for better data management, isolation of database resources, and scalability of database operations
